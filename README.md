# surfs_up

## Overview ##
The investor W. Avy has liked the previous analysis done on the precipitation levels but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. In order to complete the analysis we had to filter out the hawaii.sqlite database for the months of June and December

## Results ##

1) All the statistics for June are slightly higher than the statistics of December
2) Even though the statistics for June are slightly higher than December there isnt much difference in terms of how the data is spread for both the months
3) Both the months are very suitable for surfing and having ice cream

## Summary ##
The temperature analysis has proven that both the months are good for opening up a business of surfing and ice cream shop as the temperatures are ideal for both the activities.

Additional queries that can be written to better the analysis for June and December would be of precipitation levels and weather station data from which the data is gathered for the two months. Precipitation levels can be a determining factor as high preciptation means more rainfall which is not condusive for surfing. Also the weather station data woud help choose the propective location.
